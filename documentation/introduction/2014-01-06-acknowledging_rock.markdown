If you are using Rock and present the work you’ve done using it, we would be
glad if you could acknowledge the project. In general, the citation would be:

<pre>Rock: The Robot Construction Kit (http://rock-robotics.org)</pre>

It is better to cite this website’s URL as well as the project name.

Latex users can also use <a href="rock.bib">this bibtex entry</a>
