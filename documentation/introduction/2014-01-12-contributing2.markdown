<p>There are multiple ways to contribute to Rock</p>

<p>First and foremost, you can <a href="bugreports.html">report bugs</a> on the Trac
interface, send comments and suggest enhancements (both positive and negative
ones) to the <a href="http://www.dfki.de/mailman/cgi-bin/listinfo/rock-users">rock-users</a> mailing
lists.</p>

<p>One thing that is always in need of contribution is documentation: create new
pages <a href="http://rock.opendfki.de">on the Rock trac</a> or <a href="documentation.html">update the Rock reference
documentation</a> on the Rock website.</p>

<p>More advanced users can contribute bugfixes and enhancements to the main Rock
codebase, by either sending patches to the rock-users mailing list or using
gitorious cloning and merge request functionality. We also welcome you to
<a href="packages.html">publish packages and tell us about them</a> so that they become
part of the Rock package directory.</p>
